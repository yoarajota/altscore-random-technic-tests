    The Keeper of Secrets, Elven Lore,
    Guards the door to ancient war.
    A name in whispers, subtly veiled,
    The key to forge the fading light.

    A password cloaked in shadows deep,
    Where truth and trust in darkness sleep.
    Reveal the word, but tread with care,
    For only those who dare to star.

    Through websites of spells and runes that guard,
    The path to wisdom, worn and hard.
    The quest is yours, the way is paved,
    By username in light engraved.

    Password bound by hidden might,
    Shift the veil, and find the light.
